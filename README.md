# ola_calib
Python parser for calibration file of OSIRIS-REX OLA instrument

## Instructions

* Locate the calibration file (potential file name: `ola_cal_file.txt`) for the OLA calibration and put it next to this Python module
* Use as indicated in the notebook, use object inspection for all the things stored in the `cal` object.

I don't want to provide the file itself here, as it might change and it is unlikely that I will be able to track those changes and I don't want to spread an out of date calibration file.

The OLA team also could clone my script and use at their liberty in their documents.
